 A set stores distinct values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. A dictionary stores associations between keys of the same type and values of the same type in a collection with no defined ordering. Each value is associated with a unique key, which acts as an identifier for that value within the dictionary.

The ord() function returns the number representing the unicode code of a specified character. The ord() function in Python accepts a string of length 1 as an argument and returns the unicode code point representation of the passed argument. For example ord('B') returns 66 which is a unicode code point value of character ‘B’.
